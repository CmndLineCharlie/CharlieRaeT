 this branch contains 
an output.txt created from an ad-hoc command from your machine and my personal machine. Yes, (1) of the 2 ip addresses under group, "chris" included yours. 

Secondly i created a playbook to copying that file into your root directory. On your machine, you should be able to view that file as /root/Chrisoutput or something like that

Thirdly, also using the playbook, i zipped up my /root/output.txt ond shared them with you. This was my interpretation of a "archive module"
